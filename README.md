# Azania
An online portal to learn and share about African Urban Culture

1. Introduction: A brief introduction to your website idea. State the goals of the project.

African users are often curious Urban culture in various parts of Africa but can not access this information on traditional media. Azania will start out as a culture blog that will grow to catalogue topics and information pages of interest.

2. Expected List of Features

Blogging: Ability to create blog posts with tags
Accounts: Users will sign in to be able to blog
Interaction: Users can interact with each other by following each other, commenting and liking blog posts
Feed: Each user will have a feed of the latest posts by those that they follow

3. Market Survey: Do a survey of the Web to find about five web sites that might have similar ideas as yours

https://www.okayafrica.com/ is a fantastic news site dedicated to the African urban customer, but does not have functionality to let users blog

https://www.bellanaija.com/ is a great news site similar to Okay Africa.

https://medium.com/ is a fantastic self-blogging/publishing platform and will be a foundation for the blogging platform structure that I would like to use. The challenge with medium is that it's user interfact can be overwhelming with all the topics placed on the front page.

https://dev.to/ is even better than medium because its focusded on developers blogging for each other. It also has a simpler user interface.

https://www.nairaland.com/ is a great community forum site. Although it leans more towards a combinaion of Craigslist and a news forum, it would be great if it had an inerface that was easier to navigate.
